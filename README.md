Initial observations, 

A Resevoir is taken out of action 18years from now, or there is a commitment to send water elsewhere, creating a deficit regardless of demand option chosen. 
Spend pattern of demand option 2, 3 & 5 suggest a rollout of meters, with spike in spend in the next AMP and subsequent smaller spikes (for replacement). 
 
Ignoring CAPEX for now, Observing Value in terms of  Benefit/ OPEX (Ml/£m),
 
•	Almost every Supply Option provides better value than demand strategies(albeit capex needs accounting for). Looking at this in terms of efficiency only, a lower benefit demand option, topped up with supply options to provide required freeboard looks like it provide the most cost effective, (there may be other requirements – eg regulatory targets for leakage reduction). 
•	Demand stategies 3 and 5 (which may have higher commitments to leakage reduction?) are unattractive given high maintenance cost throughout the planning period. They perhaps Over-deliver on reducing demand when it is not cost-effective and there is enough headroom anyway.
•	There are some clear favourites in terms of efficiency, Option combinations should probably priorize,

o	 New Reservoir A, 
o	import from neighbouring company A, 
o	import from neighbouring company C 
o	New Reservoir C
o	Drought option is probably better a good backup plan to include in any combination given low lead in period (hosepipe ban), 

It's a good sign that the monte carlo simulation is working and enough iterations have been tested if these options make an appearance
